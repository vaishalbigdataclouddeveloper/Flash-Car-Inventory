# Flash-Car-Inventory
This project I did in my college as one of the major project assignment

The project stores the inventory of new and used cars. Records important details of the car like manufacturer name, date of purchase, Kilometers ran (in case of used cars), price, model and more. Using this application the customer can easily find the car as per his interest.

This project is basically having Core Java components.

This project is helping to make car repository at a small level.

Here for administrator, it is easy to store car details and Users can easily find the available car's list which fulfills their criteria.

For this project, I took references from some of the already developed projects for a similar purpose.
