# Flash-Car-Inventory
This project I did in my college as one of the major project assignment

The project stores the inventory of new and used cars. Records important details of the car like manufacturer name, date of purchase, Kilo meters ran (in case of used cars), price, model and more. Using this application the customer can easily find the car as per his interest.

This project is basically having Core Java components. 

This project is helpful to make car repository at small level. 

Here for administrator,it is easy to store car details and Users can easily find the available car's list which fulfill their criteria.

For this project,I took refrences from some of already developed projects for similar purpose.
